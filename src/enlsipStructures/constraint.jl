    Constraint

Struct used to represent the active constraints

Fields are the useful informations about active constraints at a point x :

* `cx` : Vector of size t, contains values of constraints in current working set

* `A` : Matrix of size `t` x `t`, jacobian matrix of constraints in current working set

* `scaling` : Boolean indicating if internal scaling of `cx` and `A` is done 

* `diag_scale` : Vector of size `t`, contains the diagonal elements of the scaling matrix if internal scaling is done 

    - The i-th element equals ``\\dfrac{1}{\\|\\nabla c_i(x)\\|}`` for ``i = 1,...,t``, which is the inverse of the length of `A` i-th row 
    - Otherwise, it contains the length of each row in the matrix `A`

# EVSCAL 
# Scale jacobian matrix of active constraints A and active constraints evaluation vector cx if so indicated (ie if scale different from 0) by forming vectors :
# diag*A and diag*cx
# where diag is an array of dimension whose i-th element equals either ||∇c_i(x)|| or  (1/||∇c_i(x)|) depending on wether scaling is done or not. 
# The vectors are formed by modifying in place matrix A and vector cx
