# ENLSIP-Julia

Files for the transcription of the constrained non linear least squares algorithm named ENLSIP from Fortran77 to Julia.

Folder organigrammes contains diagrams that show the different dependencies between the modules of the algorithm.

The intermediate versions of ENLSIP solver in Julia can be found in 'ENLSIP-JULIA-0.x.0' (for x = 1,2,...).
